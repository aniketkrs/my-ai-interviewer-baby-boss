🚀 AI Interview Simulator: From Rejection to a Real Solution
After facing a series of rejections this interview season, I realised something. Instead of just preparing harder, why not build a product to solve the core problem of interview preparation itself? 💡 Coming from a product background, I believe building a tangible MVP that addresses real user pain points is far more valuable than endless theoretical prep.
This project is the result: a realistic, AI-powered interview simulator designed to provide the kind of actionable feedback I wished I had. 🎯
📖 The Story
The job hunt is tough. 😤 Generic interview advice and practising in front of a mirror can only get you so far. I wanted to create an experience that felt real—a conversation with an experienced hiring manager who asks relevant follow-up questions and provides truly constructive feedback.
I decided to build it myself, diving deep into the world of LLMs and modern web technologies to create a tool that could help others (and myself) build confidence and polish their skills. ✨
This project is more than a portfolio piece; it's a testament to turning personal struggle into a problem-solving opportunity. 🔄

🛠️ A Note on the Build Process
In the spirit of full transparency, I want to clarify my role in creating this simulator. As a Product Manager, my expertise lies in problem discovery, user research, and solution design. While I understand the theory behind the code, I am not a professional developer. 👨‍💻
I built this project by extensively using AI development tools. My goal was to prove a core belief: a product person with a clear vision can leverage AI to build a functional MVP like this one. 🤖 It's about rapidly bringing a solution to life to test a hypothesis and solve a real problem. This project is a practical example of that philosophy in action.
