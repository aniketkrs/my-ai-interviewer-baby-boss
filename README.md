# 🤖 AI Interview Simulator: From Rejection to Real Solution

> _“Why just prepare harder… when you can build smarter?”_

After getting ghosted more times than I care to admit this interview season 👻, I had a realization. Instead of endlessly prepping, what if I built a **real solution** to the core problem?

As a product guy with a tinkering itch, I turned frustration into fuel — and this project is the result:  
👉🏽 A **realistic, AI-powered interview simulator** that gives the kind of actionable feedback I always wished I had.

## 🎬 The Story

Job hunting is brutal — let’s not sugarcoat it 🍭.  
Mock interviews? Often robotic.  
Mirror practice? Awkward 🙃.  
Advice blogs? Generic at best.

I wanted something that felt *real* — like sitting across from a tough but fair hiring manager who actually challenges you. So I built one:  
Meet **“Alex,”** your AI interviewer — built with 💪 Gemini AI + web tech magic.

This isn't just a passion project — it’s my way of turning rejection into resilience.

## ⚙️ My Role in the Build

Let's keep it 💯:

I'm not a full-time dev. I'm a **Product Manager** — my superpowers lie in:

- 🕵️‍♂️ Discovering real user pain
- 🗺️ Designing thoughtful solutions
- 🧪 Testing MVPs to validate ideas

So, how’d I build this?  
With help from... *AI dev tools* (because, why not use AI to build an AI for AI-era interviews 😎).  
I stitched it all together, focusing on functionality over flair.

This project proves what I believe deeply:  
> **A product thinker with the right tools can ship working software — fast.**
